# Vehicle Sales Price Prediction App (Python/HTML)

This repository is for hosting the files used to build the [Heroku web app](https://predict-vehicle-price.herokuapp.com/) based on [the analysis and models built on a vehicle sales dataset](https://github.com/MichaelBryantDS/vehicle-price-pred). Below you will find an overview of the code and files. The goal of this project was to create an end-to-end project where I perform an exploratory data analysis, prepare the data (i.e., clean and feature engineer), apply machine learning algorithms to predict the sales price of vehicles, and create a deployed application with a front end to productionize the best performing model.

### Code Used 

**Python Version:** 3.8.11 <br />
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, flask, pickle<br />
**For Web Framework Requirements:**  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
